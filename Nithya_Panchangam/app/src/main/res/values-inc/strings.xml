    <string name="humble_namaskarams">The primary aim of this app is to enable people to conveniently reckon the daily panchaangam, as well as various festivals &amp; observances. We apologise for any inadvertent errors that may have crept in, and request feedback for improvement. We dedicate this App to scholars and Panchaanga-karta(s) across the country, who have mastered these calculations and participate in Panchanga Sadas across the country, debating the nitty-gritties of various aspects of Panchangam(s). We request all app users to continue to support their traditional Panchanga(s), Panchanga-karta(s), and family Vathiyar(s). 🙏 Pls send your feedback to gkmhcreations@gmail.com.</string>
